# Personal self-hosting (homelab) repo

This project describes my personal self-hosted infrastructure setup, running on a Raspberry Pi 4 board (for now).

This was meant to be just a reminder for me as I can never trust my brain, now I am making it publicly available in case it might help someone out there.

It uses only free and open source software and hardware.

## Objective

I started this project in summer 2023 as a **home lab**, for learning, the goal was to have an environment :

- **100% self-hosted** (privacy preserving, full control over data and software)
- **Secure** (authentication, SSL/TLS, firewall, ad-blocking, DDOS protection, rate limiting, custom DNS resolver, ...)
- **Lightweight** (runs smoothly with minimal hardware and software requirements)
- **Container-ready** (isolated, portable, scalable applications)
- **Accessible** (some services accessible only locally, some only through VPN, some publicly on the internet)
- **Supervised** (monitoring, alerting, tracking, and backup tools)
- **Resource efficient** (The electricity in the country where I live is quite expensive, so I needed to run something resource efficient)
